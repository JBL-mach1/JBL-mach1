- 👋 Hi, I’m @JBL-mach1
- 👀 I’m interested in ... snow science, measurements and instrumentation, mechanics, dynamics, fracture mechanics, remote sensing, numerical methods, and generally all things engineering! I love a good challenge and topics that make my head spin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about digital signal processing & digital filters. Always working towards better understanding of MATLAB and the wonderful tools it offers. Recently I spent a great deal of time learning the basics of C, some C++, a little about microcontrollers and a lot about MEMS! The next adventure is into learning how to navigate and use Visual Basic, improving my understanding of C++, and learning about CPU architecture.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... solid modeling and design, prototyping, sensing devices, and designing software to control them!
- 📫 How to reach me ... jameslesser@montana.edu (school/work), j.lesser@hotmail.com (personal).
