- 👋 Hi, I’m @JBL-mach1
- 👀 I’m interested in ... snow science, measurements and instrumentation, mechanics, dynamics, fracture mechanics, remote sensing, numerical methods, and generally all things engineering! I love a good challenge and topics that make my head spin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about digital signal processing, digital filters. Always increasing my understanding of MATLAB and the wonderful tools it offers. Recently spent a great deal of time learning the basics of C, the next adventure is into the supporting files & improving my understanding of C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... solid modeling and design, prototyping, sensing devices, and the software that control them!
- 📫 How to reach me ... jameslesser@montana.edu, j.lesser@hotmail.com.
